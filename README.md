# Forecasting Reservoir Storage

## Final Project - UCLA Stats 415: Forecasting (Fall 2018)


The final project for this cousre was to find a time-series dataset and analyze it using some of the forecasting methods from class.

Since my father is a civil engineer he provided me with reservoir storage data for one of the projects he has been working on. This data is not meant for public record and therefore the dataset could not be included in this repository. However the report findings and R Code is included.
